# Sound
Sound is a simple discord music bot written in C# .NET 5  
This bot has been made to "replace" Rythm/Groovy discord music bot since they have been both taken down by YouTube.  

## About this app
This bot does not support and will never support multiple server.  
This choice has been made to avoid issues with YouTube like Rythm/Groovy bots.  
So if you want to use Sound on your server you will need to create your own bot token and host this app yourself.

### Usage
- Install .NET 5.0
- Create a discord application with a bot
- Add this bot to your discord server
- Add your bot token into your environment variables (TOKEN)
- Build & Start application
